# Super Duper High-Performance TCP Server

## Overview

Welcome to the **Super Duper High-Performance TCP Transport**! This Go-based transport is engineered for blazing-fast performance and scalability, making it ideal for demanding applications that require efficient handling of numerous concurrent TCP connections.

## Features

- **High Concurrency**: Leverages Go's lightweight goroutines for handling thousands of simultaneous connections.
- **Optimized Performance**: Designed with high throughput and low latency in mind.
- **Scalable**: Easily scales to handle increasing workloads.
- **Customizable**: Modular architecture allows easy extension and configuration.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Resilient to connection errors and supports graceful recovery.

## Requirements

- Go version 1.18 or later
- A modern OS (Linux, macOS, Windows, etc.)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ukibbb/tcp-server.git
   cd super-duper-tcp-server
   ```

2. Build the project:

   ```bash
   go build -o tcp-server
   ```

3. Run the server:

   ```bash
   ./tcp-server
   ```

## Usage

### Configuration

The server can be configured via a `config.json` file. Here's an example configuration:

```json
{
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": 8080,
  "max_connections": 10000,
  "read_timeout": 30,
  "write_timeout": 30
}
```

- **host**: The IP address to bind the server.
- **port**: The port number for incoming connections.
- **max_connections**: Maximum concurrent client connections.
- **read_timeout**: Timeout for reading data from a client (in seconds).
- **write_timeout**: Timeout for writing data to a client (in seconds).

### Running the Server

Simply execute the server binary:

```bash
./tcp-server -config=config.json
```

### API

The TCP server uses a custom protocol for client-server communication. Details of the protocol can be found in the `PROTOCOL.md` file.

### Logging

Server logs provide detailed information about connections, errors, and server events. Logs are written to `logs/server.log` by default.

## Development

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

2. Run the server in development mode:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

3. Test the server:

   ```bash
   go test ./...
   ```

## Performance Testing

You can use tools like `wrk` or `Apache Benchmark` to stress test the server. Example:

```bash
wrk -t12 -c400 -d30s tcp://127.0.0.1:8080
```
